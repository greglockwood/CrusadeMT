[README NOT REALLY DONE YET]

Will add any instructions here as they occur to me.

To get up and running, be sure to run the following rake tasks:
1. rake db:migrate
   Should create and set up the current database and some necessary records.
2. rake db:populate:sample_data
   Creates about 65 sample clients (and 1000 people) using semi-realistic values and random strings. Logic based off specifications given by AJ. If you don't like what it generates, you can always run it again and it will regenerate the data.
   BEWARE! This erases many tables in the database, and populates it with sample data. Don't run it if you want to at all keep the data in there, including any additional field ministries.

My Todo Tasks:
1. Refactor the primary, high school, uni thing using Single Table Inheritance. (Done)
   See this link for details: http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Base.html, Single Table Inheritance section
2. Include an 'Any' option for field ministry involvements when searching, so that it picks up clients not involved in any ministry at the moment
3. CSV Export of all data
4. CSV Export of email addresses
5. Link Profile link on results page to actual profile page
6. Create profile page
7. Many more tests
8. Dynamic title and green header bar text
9. Info pages for things like churches, workplaces, etc
