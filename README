i[README NOT REALLY DONE YET]

Will add any instructions here as they occur to me.

To get up and running, or after updating from GitHub, be sure to run the following rake tasks:
1. rake db:migrate:reset
   Should re-create and set up the current database and some necessary records.
2. rake db:populate:sample_data
   Creates about 65 sample clients (and 1000 people) using semi-realistic values and random strings. Logic based off specifications given by AJ. If you don't like what it generates, you can always run it again and it will regenerate the data.
   BEWARE! This erases many tables in the database, and populates it with sample data. Don't run it if you want to at all keep the data in there, including any additional field ministries.

You should also ensure you have the rcov gem installed. 'sudo gem install rcov' at the command line should do the trick if not.
All the other gems needed should be included in the vendor directory.
